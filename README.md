# ft_linear_regression

A linear regression implementation using gradient descent in Python for 42 School's `ft_linear_regression` project. This project aims to predict car prices based on their mileage. The dataset used for training is provided in `data.csv`. This project is a work in progress.

## Features

- **Gradient Descent Algorithm**: Implements gradient descent to optimize the slope (`m`) and intercept (`c`) of the linear regression model.
- **Data Normalization**: Scales the input data for better performance during training.
- **Visualization**: Plots the data points and the regression line for better understanding of the fit.
